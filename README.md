Dr Kenny Chiu ðŸ˜Š
Clinical Psychologist | Researcher | AI & Data Science Enthusiast

Hi, Iâ€™m Dr Kenny Chiuâ€”a clinical psychologist, clinical lecturer, and research tutor with a passion for advancing mental health through evidence-based practice and innovative technology. My work bridges clinical psychology, digital mental health, and applied AI, with a focus on young peopleâ€™s wellbeing.

ðŸ”¬ Research
I investigate neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions (ADHD, social anxiety, resilience), using both qualitative and quantitative methods. My recent projects explore the intersection of AI, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and digital tools for real-time mental health monitoring.

ðŸ’» Tech & Data
Iâ€™m exploring Python, pandas, and AI-powered analytics to make sense of complex datasets in clinical psychology research. I experiment with LLMs, open-source AI assistants (like Gemini CLI), and automation tools to streamline research workflows and data analysis.

ðŸŽ“ Teaching & Mentorship
As a lecturer and research tutor, I support students and early-career researchers in developing robust research skills, critical thinking, and ethical approaches to digital health.

ðŸ¤– AI for Good
Iâ€™m interested in ethical and safety frameworks for AI in mental health, and how genAI and AI agents can improve participation and outcomes for young people.

ðŸ©º Clinical Practice
My clinical work is grounded in compassion and evidence, with experience in assessment, therapy, and service evaluation across diverse settings.

Always keen to collaborate on projects at the intersection of mental health, data science, and digital innovation. Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
